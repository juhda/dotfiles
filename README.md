# dotfiles

My general setup for Codespaces

## How to Use

- Enable *this* repository as [dotfiles repository for Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-your-user-preferences/personalizing-github-codespaces-for-your-account#enabling-your-dotfiles-repository-for-codespaces).
- Once the Codespace is created, open a terminal to start `bash` and complete the final setup steps.
- Enjoy!

> **Note**: Some setup steps require all standard software to be installed in the Codespace. These steps are postponed until after the Codespace is created.
> Since dotfiles do not support postponed execution of scripts directly, we fall back to using `.bashrc` to take care of those steps the first time the shell is started.
